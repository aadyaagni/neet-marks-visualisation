# NEET Marks Visualization

This project visualizes my NEET exam journey over four years (2021â€“2024) using a bar plot in R.

## ðŸ“Š Data
The dataset includes the NEET marks I scored each year:
- 2021: 386
- 2022: 505
- 2023: 580
- 2024: 610

Stored in: `neet_marks_data.csv`

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization
The barplot is created using base R functions and styled with:
- Custom colors
- Axis labels
- Title
- Y-axis limit (out of 720)

Script file: `neet_visualization.R`

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the `.R` script in R or RStudio.
2. Run the code to generate the bar chart.
3. You can export the plot as a PDF or PNG for presentations.

## âœ¨ Why This Project?
I made this as a personal milestone tracker and to start learning data visualization in R. It's a small but meaningful step in my learning journey!
